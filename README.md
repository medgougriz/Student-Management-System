# 🎓 Student Management System

A simple web application for managing student data using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **LocalStorage**.  
It provides an easy-to-use interface to add, update, delete, and search students, with data stored locally in the browser.

## 🚀 Features
- ➕ **Add new student** (Full Name, Email, Score).
- 🔄 **Update student data** directly from the table.
- ❌ **Delete student** from the database.
- 🔍 **Search students** by full name.
- 💾 **Persistent storage** using LocalStorage (no external database required).
- 🎨 **Clean and modern UI** styled with CSS.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** → structure of the app.
- **CSS3** → styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** → logic for CRUD operations and search.
- **LocalStorage** → saving data permanently in the browser.
